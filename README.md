Jeet Stylus Typographic, Nib, Rupture, Browser Sync, More

Wordpress Development

I just started using stylus and jeet 5 days ago, and when i started i didn't want to use stylus itsel to convert my files.
i Prefered Gulp i think it is fast and works well for me.. so i googled aroun looking for options for my gulpfile and project,
it didn't start well since i forgot to add Jeet to my gulpfile not register it but add it into stylus,, so my code was messy at times:)
but thats fixed now ,, i messed around with it and final outcome.

Stylus jeet with typograpic, nib , rupture, browser sync connec php plus more..

works like this..

i use both stylus & Sass.
i have used sass for awhile now and i am not willing to give it up just yet.

when you write gulp serve ,, it will lunch your browser,, i develop wordpress themes so i work on php files.
when i make change to stylus file it will inject the code withour reloading the page, same goes for sass.

and then when i save a php file it will reload the browser.

works like a charm.

Jeet & rupture + stylus for the win!
